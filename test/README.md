nsolid-command-gc tests
================================================================================

From the project directory, run `npm test`.

This will run some tests to ensure the custom command responds as expected,
when used with the test application.

The script expects that:

* the [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) program is available
* the `nsolid-cli` program is available
* an N|Solid Storage server is running on localhost with the default parameters
