Building from source
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no special instructions to build this project, other than to
run `npm install` after cloning the repo, to get all the dependent packages
installed.

After making changes, you should run `npm test` to ensure all the tests
currently pass.  If you are adding or changing function, you should add tests
in either an existing test module or a new one.
